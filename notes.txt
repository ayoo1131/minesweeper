Outline to Solving Minesweeper:
Map:
	key(int 0-7 of adjacent cells) value(string position of the adjacent cells)
Center cell Object:
	member variables - 
	int -  numAdjacentUnknownCells
	map - key(int 0-7 of adjacent cells) value(symbol)
	

-First, loop through all the nonborder cells, if the cell is 1 and is adjacent to only 1 unknown cell, then that unknown cell is a bomb(corner bomb)
	Pseudocode:loop through all the center cells, if the value==1, then create a center cell object.
